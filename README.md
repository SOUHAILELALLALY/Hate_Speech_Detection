# Hate_Speech_Detection
## Project Objective
This project aims to implement a hate speech detection model using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset used for this task has been downloaded from Kaggle and was originally collected from Twitter.
## Project Stages
The project is divided into several essential stages:

    Data Preprocessing: The first step involves data preprocessing, focusing on the "tweet" column of the dataset. This includes removing special characters, text normalization, stop-word removal, and more.

    Feature Extraction: Once the data is preprocessed, we extract relevant features from the tweet texts. This may involve using word vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.

    Model Training: The core of the project is training a hate speech detection model. In this case, we used the decision tree algorithm to create our model. This model is trained using annotated data to learn to distinguish hate speech from non-hateful messages.
