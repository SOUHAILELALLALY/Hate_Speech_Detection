# Hate_Speech_Detection
## Project Objective
This project aims to implement a hate speech detection model using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset used for this task has been downloaded from Kaggle and was originally collected from Twitter.
## Project Stages
The project is divided into several essential stages:
**1-Data Preprocessing:** The first step involves data preprocessing, focusing on the "tweet" column of the dataset. This includes removing special characters and stop-word.
**2-Feature Extraction:** Once the data is preprocessed, we extract relevant features from the tweet texts. using word vectorization techniques.
**3-Model Training:** The core of the project is training a hate speech detection model. In this case, we used the **Random Forest** algorithm to create our model.
